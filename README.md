# Different-shape-detection-in-an-image
Different shapes can be detected from the input images this like ellipse, circular, Triangle etc. Also this can be used to detect the different quadrilaterals, and other different polygons.
  
  For running this code just enter the given input image and after that shape detection would be determined on the basis of approximate number of sides around a given figure. For the quadrilateral and polygon it work very accurately.
